  "description": "The `starfish` core image processing pipeline is centered around the `ImageStack` component, which serves as the primary in-memory representation for multi-dimensional image data. Data ingestion into the `ImageStack` is handled by `ImageStack Parsers`, which are responsible for converting various external data formats into the standardized `ImageStack` structure. Once loaded, the `ImageStack` can be manipulated by components like `ImageStack Cropping` for spatial transformations. The `Codebook` component plays a crucial role in interpreting the raw intensity data within the `ImageStack`, mapping observed fluorescent signals to biological targets, thereby providing biological meaning to the image data. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with dedicated components for data representation, ingestion, transformation, and biological interpretation, facilitating a modular and extensible image processing workflow.",
