  "description": "The Agentic Subsystem in DocsGPT is designed to enable intelligent, multi-step interactions by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and external tools. At its core, the `Stream Processor` orchestrates the execution flow, initiating the `ReActAgent`. The `ReActAgent`, inheriting from `BaseAgent`, implements the ReAct pattern to reason, decide on actions, and execute them. It interacts with the `LLM Tool Call Handler` to process LLM outputs, which in turn utilizes the `ToolActionParser` to interpret tool calls. The `ToolManager` is responsible for loading and providing `Individual Tools` (such as `Elevenlabs TTS`) that the `ReActAgent` can invoke to perform specific actions, thereby extending the LLM's capabilities. This modular design ensures a clear separation of concerns, facilitating robust and extensible agentic behavior.",
