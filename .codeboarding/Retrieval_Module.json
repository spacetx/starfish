  "description": "The Retrieval Module is a core subsystem responsible for efficiently fetching the most relevant document chunks from the Vector Database based on user queries. It acts as the bridge between the user's information need and the contextual data required by the Large Language Model (LLM) for generating responses. Its boundaries encompass the logic for query processing, interaction with the knowledge base, and preparation of retrieved content.",

      "description": "This component serves as a factory for instantiating various retriever implementations. It abstracts the creation process, allowing other parts of the system to obtain a retriever instance (e.g., `Classic RAG Retriever`) without needing to know the specific concrete class or its initialization details. This design promotes modularity, extensibility, and supports the project's \"LLM Agnosticism\" and \"Modularity\" architectural biases by enabling easy swapping or addition of different retrieval strategies.",
