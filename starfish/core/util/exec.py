    Parameters
    ----------
    commands : Sequence[Sequence[Union[str, Callable]]]
        A collection of tuples of commands composed either of
        str elements or callable objects which will be invoked

    subdirs : Sequence[str]
        A collection of paths which should be created as subdirectories
        within the temporary directory used by this invocation.
    keep_data : bool

        directory used by this invocation.
    STARFISH_COVERAGE :
        This parameter is read from the environment. If set, then command lists will have
        `coverage run ...` options prepended before execution.

    ------
