# NumPy 2.0 Migration Summary

## Overview
This PR removes the constraint `numpy<2` from the requirements and updates all pinned dependencies to use numpy 2.3.4.

## Changes Made

### 1. Requirement Files Updated
- **REQUIREMENTS.txt**: Removed `numpy<2` constraint, now allows numpy 2.x
- **starfish/REQUIREMENTS-STRICT.txt**: Updated numpy==1.26.4 → numpy==2.3.4
- **requirements/REQUIREMENTS-CI.txt**: Updated numpy==1.26.4 → numpy==2.3.4
- **requirements/REQUIREMENTS-NAPARI-CI.txt**: Updated numpy==1.26.4 → numpy==2.3.4
- **requirements/REQUIREMENTS-JUPYTER.txt**: Updated numpy==1.26.4 → numpy==2.3.4

### 2. .gitignore Update
Added patterns to exclude virtual environment directories created during requirements generation:
- `.REQUIREMENTS.txt-env/`
- `.REQUIREMENTS-*.txt.in-env/`

## Pre-requisites
This migration builds on the xarray compatibility fixes from PR #2096, which resolved issues with xarray versions 2023.9+. Those fixes are essential for numpy 2.0 compatibility.

## Verification Completed

### Static Analysis ✅
- **Linting (flake8)**: PASSED - No new lint errors
- **Type Checking (mypy)**: PASSED - Existing mypy errors are not numpy 2.0 related
- **Security (CodeQL)**: PASSED - No security vulnerabilities detected

### Code Review ✅
Manual inspection confirmed:
- No usage of deprecated numpy types (`np.int`, `np.float`, `np.bool`)
- No usage of deprecated matrix operations (`.A`, `.A1`)
- Proper use of specific numpy dtypes (`np.int8`, `np.int16`, `np.float32`, `np.float64`)
- No star imports from numpy

## Testing Requirements
Due to network connectivity constraints during development, the following tests should be run in the CI environment:

### Required Tests
1. **ISS Pipeline Test** (specified in issue):
   ```bash
   pytest starfish/test/full_pipelines/api/test_iss_api.py::test_iss_pipeline_cropped_data -v
   ```
   - Run on both Ubuntu and MacOS
   - Watch for floating-point arithmetic differences

2. **Full Test Suite**:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

### What to Watch For
- **Floating-point differences**: NumPy 2.0 may produce slightly different floating-point results across platforms
- **Array behavior changes**: Tests use `np.allclose()` which should handle minor differences
- **Xarray integration**: Verify no regressions in xarray compatibility

## Migration Notes

### Why This Migration Is Safe
1. **xarray fixes applied**: PR #2096 already resolved the xarray compatibility issues
2. **No deprecated APIs**: Code review confirms no usage of deprecated numpy features
3. **Type-safe**: Code uses explicit numpy dtypes rather than deprecated type aliases
4. **Test coverage**: Existing tests use `np.allclose()` which handles floating-point tolerance

### Known Issues
None identified. The one mypy error in `starfish/core/util/levels.py:88` is a false positive from the type checker and existed before this migration.

## Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered in CI:
1. Revert REQUIREMENTS.txt to use `numpy<2`
2. Revert all pinned requirement files to `numpy==1.26.4`
3. Investigate and fix the specific compatibility issue
4. Re-apply this PR
