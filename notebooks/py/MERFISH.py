### Reproduce Published MERFISH results with Starfish
#
#Multiplexed Error Robust Fish (MERFISH) is an image based transcriptomics technique that can spatially resolve hundreds to thousands of RNA species and their expression levels in-situ. The protocol and data analysis are described in this [publication](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6233/aaa6090). This notebook walks through  how to use Starfish to process the raw images from a MERFISH experiment into a spatially resolved cell by gene expression matrix. We verify that Starfish can accurately reproduce the results from the current Matlab based MERFISH [pipeline](https://github.com/ZhuangLab/MERFISH_analysis)
#
#Please see [documentation](https://spacetx-starfish.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for detailed descriptions of all the data structures and methods used here.

### Load Data into Starfish from the Cloud
#
#The data from one field of view correspond to 16 images from 8 hybridzation rounds (r)  2 color channels (c) one z plane (z). Each image is 2048X2048 (y,x). These data correspond to U2OS cells in culture. O(100) transcripts are barcoded for subsequent spatial resolution. Pixel intensity values for one pixel, across all rounds and channels, can be decoded into the nearest barcode, thus resolving each pixel into a particular gene.

### Visualize codebook
#
#The MERFISH codebook maps each barcode to a gene (or blank) feature. The barcodes are 16 bit vectors that can be read out, for each pixel, from the 8 rounds and 2 color channels. The codebook contains a precise specificaton of how each of these 16 bit barcode vectors relate to the 5D tensor of raw image data

#The below algorithm deconvolves the point spread function (PSF) introduced by the microcope. The goal of deconvolution is to enable the resolution of more spots, especially in high transcript density regions of the data. For this assay, the PSF is well approximated by a 2D isotropic gaussian with standard deviation (sigma) of 2. This The number of iterations (here 15) is an important parameter that needs careful optimization.

#The data for this assay are already registered across imaging rounds. Despite this, individual RNA molecules may still not be perfectly aligned across imaging rounds. This is crucial in order to read out a measure of the itended barcode (across imaging rounds) in order to map it to the codebook. To solve for potential mis-alignment, the images can be blurred with a 1-pixel Gaussian kernel. The risk here is that this will obfuscate signals from nearby molecules, thus potentially working against the deconvolution step from the previous cell!

### Decode the processed data into spatially resolved gene expression profiles
#
#Here, we decode each pixel value, across all rounds and channels, into the corresponding target (gene) it corresponds too. Contiguous pixels that map to the same target gene are called as one RNA molecule. Intuitively, pixel vectors are matched to the codebook by computing the euclidean distance between the pixel vector and all codewords. The minimal distance gene target is selected if it lies within `distance_threshold` of a code.

### Compare to results from paper

#The below plot aggregates gene copy number across single cells in the field of view and compares the results to the published counts in the MERFISH paper. Note that Starfish detects a lower number of transcripts than the authors' results. This can likely be improved by tweaking the parameters of the algorithms above.
