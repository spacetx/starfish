  "description": "The `starfish` core data persistence layer is responsible for serializing and exporting processed biological data, ensuring data integrity and accessibility for downstream analysis. Key components include `ImageStack` for managing and exporting multi-dimensional image data into formats like multi-page TIFF, `DecodedSpots` for persisting decoded biological spot information into tabular formats such as CSV, and `BinaryMaskIO` which handles the specialized, versioned storage of binary mask data. These components primarily interact by taking processed in-memory data structures and writing them to disk in standardized formats, facilitating data sharing and reproducibility in scientific workflows.",
