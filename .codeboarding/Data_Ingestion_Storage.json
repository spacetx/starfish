  "description": "The DocsGPT system is designed around a modular data processing pipeline. It begins with the `Data Source Ingestion` component, responsible for acquiring raw data from diverse origins. This data then proceeds to `Document Chunking`, where it is segmented into optimized units. The `Embedding Pipeline` subsequently transforms these chunks into vector embeddings, which are crucial for knowledge representation. For persistent storage of these embeddings, the `Embedding Pipeline` interacts exclusively with the `Storage Abstraction` layer. This abstraction layer intelligently delegates storage operations to specific backends, such as `Local Storage` for local persistence or `S3 Storage` for scalable cloud-based storage, thereby ensuring a flexible and decoupled storage mechanism.",
