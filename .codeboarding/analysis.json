  "description": "The Starfish project is structured around a robust data processing pipeline for spatial transcriptomics. It begins with a `Data Input & Validation Layer` responsible for ingesting and validating raw experimental data against the SpaceTx format. This validated data is then transformed into `Core Data Structures`, primarily multi-dimensional image stacks and codebooks, which serve as the central in-memory representation. The `Image Processing Engine` operates on these image stacks, applying various algorithms for enhancement and transformation. Concurrently, the `Spot Analysis Engine` identifies, quantifies, and decodes biological spots using both the processed images and the codebook. Finally, the `Output & Export Layer` handles the serialization and persistence of all processed data, while `Visualization Utilities` provide crucial tools for inspecting intermediate and final results. This modular design ensures clear separation of concerns and facilitates a streamlined data flow from raw input to interpretable biological insights.",
