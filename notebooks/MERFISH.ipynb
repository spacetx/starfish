    "## Reproduce Published MERFISH results with Starfish\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplexed Error Robust Fish (MERFISH) is an image based transcriptomics technique that can spatially resolve hundreds to thousands of RNA species and their expression levels in-situ. The protocol and data analysis are described in this [publication](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6233/aaa6090). This notebook walks through  how to use Starfish to process the raw images from a MERFISH experiment into a spatially resolved cell by gene expression matrix. We verify that Starfish can accurately reproduce the results from the current Matlab based MERFISH [pipeline](https://github.com/ZhuangLab/MERFISH_analysis)\n",
