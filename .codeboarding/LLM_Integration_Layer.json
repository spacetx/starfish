  "description": "The LLM subsystem is designed around a core LLM Abstraction that provides a consistent interface for interacting with various LLM Provider Implementations. The LLM Creator is responsible for dynamically instantiating the appropriate LLM Provider Implementation based on configuration. Once an LLM interaction occurs, the LLM Response Handler orchestrates the subsequent message processing, including parsing responses and managing tool calls. The LLM Handler Creator facilitates the selection and instantiation of the correct LLM Response Handler. This architecture ensures modularity, extensibility, and LLM agnosticism by centralizing interactions through the LLM Abstraction and separating response processing logic.",
