class WhiteTophat(FilterAlgorithm):
    """
    Performs "white top hat" filtering of an image to enhance spots. White top hat filtering
    finds spots that are both smaller and brighter than their surroundings by subtracting an
    estimate of the background produced by a binary opening of the image using a disk-shaped
    structuring element.

    Parameters
    ----------
    masking_radius : int
        radius of the morphological masking structure in pixels
    is_volume : int
        If True, 3d (z, y, x) volumes will be filtered, otherwise, filter 2d tiles
        independently.
    clip_method : Optional[Union[str, :py:class:`~starfish.types.Clip`]]
        Deprecated method to control the way that data are scaled to retain skimage dtype
        requirements that float data fall in [0, 1].  In all modes, data below 0 are set to 0.

        - Clip.CLIP: data above 1 are set to 1.  This has been replaced with
          level_method=Levels.CLIP.
        - Clip.SCALE_BY_IMAGE: when any data in the entire ImageStack is greater than 1, the entire
          ImageStack is scaled by the maximum value in the ImageStack.  This has been replaced with
          level_method=Levels.SCALE_SATURATED_BY_IMAGE.
        - Clip.SCALE_BY_CHUNK: when any data in any slice is greater than 1, each slice is scaled by
          the maximum value found in that slice.  The slice shapes are determined by the
          ``group_by`` parameters.  This has been replaced with
          level_method=Levels.SCALE_SATURATED_BY_CHUNK.
    level_method : :py:class:`~starfish.types.Levels`
        Controls the way that data are scaled to retain skimage dtype requirements that float data
        fall in [0, 1].  In all modes, data below 0 are set to 0.

        - Levels.CLIP (default): data above 1 are set to 1.
        - Levels.SCALE_SATURATED_BY_IMAGE: when any data in the entire ImageStack is greater
          than 1, the entire ImageStack is scaled by the maximum value in the ImageStack.
        - Levels.SCALE_SATURATED_BY_CHUNK: when any data in any slice is greater than 1, each
          slice is scaled by the maximum value found in that slice.  The slice shapes are
          determined by the ``group_by`` parameters.
        - Levels.SCALE_BY_IMAGE: scale the entire ImageStack by the maximum value in the
          ImageStack.
        - Levels.SCALE_BY_CHUNK: scale each slice by the maximum value found in that slice.  The
          slice shapes are determined by the ``group_by`` parameters.
