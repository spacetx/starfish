  "description": "The DocsGPT application is structured around a core `App` component that orchestrates the user interface and manages the overall application flow. It renders key functional components such as `Conversation`, `Upload`, and `Settings`. The `Conversation` component provides the interactive chat interface, allowing users to query the RAG system and view responses. The `Upload` component handles the backend processing of document ingestion, integrating new knowledge into the system. The `Settings` component centralizes the application's configuration, providing critical parameters for LLM providers, API keys, and vector store settings, which are utilized by other components like `Upload`. Additionally, the `DocsGPTWidget` offers an embeddable version of the chat functionality, leveraging the core logic of the `Conversation` component for external website integration. This architecture ensures a modular and maintainable system, with clear responsibilities and interaction pathways between components.",
